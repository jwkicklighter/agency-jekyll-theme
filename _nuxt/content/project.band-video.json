  "body": "<p>The UCF Marching Knights do not have a promo video. For the past several years, I have spent my weekends during football season photographing the Marching Knights during rehearsals and performances. Over the course of the 2017 football season, I had the opportunity to use some gimbal equipment to capture footage to create a real promotional video for the band program. This is the first draft of such a video.</p>\n"
