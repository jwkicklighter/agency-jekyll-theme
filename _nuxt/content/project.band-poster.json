This poster is designed to be printed in a large format to distribute around campus and to high schools in the area for recruiting purposes. With a photograph of someone marching, someone playing in warm-ups, and someone playing in the football stands, the design is meant to create a quick impression of what a gameday feels like to the band members.</p>\n"
