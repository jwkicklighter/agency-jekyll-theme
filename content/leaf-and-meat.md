Leaf & Meat is a restaurant offering a place for vegans and their non-vegan friends to eat and socialize. I chose to go with an icon logo and a text logo. The icon is a cute cow made up largely of leaves and stems. This should help convey the unity that Leaf & Meat is trying to promote. The background color is green to help draw out the leaves since the cow is likely the first part noticed. The text is a formal typeface, to help promote a sense of quality and refinement. There are leaves added to the text, which should give the logo a bit more of a whimsical feel without making it too “silly.”
